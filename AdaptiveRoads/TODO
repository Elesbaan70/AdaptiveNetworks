- Patch DC nodes and bend nodes to use AR flags.

- bug: fix lod is not loaded the first time.
    - AR metadata is also not loaded.
    - calling rebuild lods in AssetImporterWizard and OnLoadPatch fixes the lod problem
      but I need a solution that also fixes the missing metadata.


- decide in which direction I need to layout the segment's start/end node/segmentEnd flags.
  should it be influenced by invert?

- hint for vanilla flags/drop-downs (waiting for Hockenheim)

- learn usage of vanilla lane flags:
    - oneway left/right start/end



version 2:
    mixed enum type bitmask
    custom flags
        data manager to manage them.
        UI to control them.
        all the network persistancy features.
