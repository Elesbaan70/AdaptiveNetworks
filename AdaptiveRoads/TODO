    bugs:
        - import mesh name does not update (or the mesh is lagging by one)
    - loading bugs:
        - load(startup) -> save(overwrite) :
            - some times error : cannot serialize mesh
            - always does not save mesh.
            - duplicate package name
TODO:
- remove custom flags when network is deleted.
- list scrollbars
- group DC components.


----------------------------
version 3:
    - export/import road xml.
    - patch AssetImporterAssetTemplate.RefreshCoroutine() to speed up prop model loading time
        micro-benchmark UIComponent.Find<T>(string) to see how much time they take up
    - move DPT array elements up and down.
