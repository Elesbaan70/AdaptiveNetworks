TODO:
    add Speed Limits to my DEMO road: done
    do not allow switch Forward/Backward on uni-directional lanes
    switch LHT should only negate pos.x (if any) on uni-directional lanes.

    load models from sub-folderes
    hint for clicking on prop model
    speed limit hint (0-> max=?  , to is exclusive)
    Test Road with DC mod
    rename toggle dir/side to switch dir/side

version 2:
    remove unecessary patches outside of asset editor.
    mixed enum type bitmask
    custom flags
        data manager to manage them.
        UI to control them.
        all the network persistancy features.
    - export/import road xml.

    - patch AssetImporterAssetTemplate.RefreshCoroutine() to speed up prop model loading time
        micro-benchmark UIComponent.Find<T>(string) to see how much time they take up
    - m_clipSegmentEnds for segmentInfos. (this influences corners so its hard to do it per mesh)
