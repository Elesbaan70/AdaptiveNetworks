TODO:
- remove custom flags when network is deleted.
- list scrollbars
- group DC components.
- what if somebody changed the number of lanes in the asset and then AR NS data is deserialized with different lane count?


----------------------------
version 3:
    - export/import road xml.
    - patch AssetImporterAssetTemplate.RefreshCoroutine() to speed up prop model loading time
        micro-benchmark UIComponent.Find<T>(string) to see how much time they take up
    - m_clipSegmentEnds for segmentInfos. (this influences corners so its hard to do it per mesh)
    - option to un-merge bitmask dropdowns
    - move DPT array elements up and down.
    - tracks
