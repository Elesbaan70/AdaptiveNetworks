Tracks:
    - asym Track
    - embankment
        - prop embankment
        - wire embankment

    - test: render while drawing | refreshLOD + ULOD |  nodeless | vehicle tilt
    - test failed : 
        - regression: tracks render regression 
        - render while drawing (end dir is 180 wrong) *
        - conditional embnakment UI *
        - tilting seems to influence both segment ends. 

TODO:
- remove custom flags when network is deleted.
- list scrollbars
- group DC components.


----------------------------
version 3:
    - export/import road xml.
    - patch AssetImporterAssetTemplate.RefreshCoroutine() to speed up prop model loading time
        micro-benchmark UIComponent.Find<T>(string) to see how much time they take up
    - m_clipSegmentEnds for segmentInfos. (this influences corners so its hard to do it per mesh)
    - option to unmerge bit-mask drop-downs
    - move DPT array elements up and down.
