tracks:
- why do I need to refresh roads 2 times on load?

- test unbroken median flag.

- remove custom flags when network is deleted.
- list scrollbars
- group DC components.

version 4:
    - export/import road xml.
    - patch AssetImporterAssetTemplate.RefreshCoroutine() to speed up prop model loading time
        micro-benchmark UIComponent.Find<T>(string) to see how much time they take up
    - check track's node/segment flags at segment's/node's : start/end/both (on demand if somebody ask for this feature)
