- bugs:
    - the drop down is problematic when clicking on another DPT without closign the first one.
    - test inverted duplicate works
    - Toggle LHT needs to toggle left/right for extension flags too.

flags for:
    merging/splitting lanes
    slight left/right
    sharp left/right

- create templates:
    yield/stop
    uturn props/sign
    parking/no paking
    pedestrian crossing sign
    no left/right turn
    speed limits KPH/MPH

    traffic lights
    man holes
    lane arrows

create road with following props:
    uturn sign (moddded)
    yeild/sign (vanilla + modded)
    stop/yeild lines.
    no left/right turn sign (vanilla + modded)
    parking signs (vanilla + modded)

    no crossing texture
    DC node

- move DPT array elements up and down.

----------------------------
version 2:
    remove unecessary patches outside of asset editor.
    mixed enum type bitmask
    custom flags
        data manager to manage them.
        UI to control them.
        all the network persistancy features.
    - export/import road xml.

    - patch AssetImporterAssetTemplate.RefreshCoroutine() to speed up prop model loading time
        micro-benchmark UIComponent.Find<T>(string) to see how much time they take up
    - m_clipSegmentEnds for segmentInfos. (this influences corners so its hard to do it per mesh)
