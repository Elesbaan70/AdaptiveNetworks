Tracks:
    - asym Track
    - embankment
        - prop embankment
        - wire embankment

    - test: render while drawing | refreshLOD + ULOD |  node-less | vehicle tilt
    - test failed : 
        - render while drawing (way off!) 
        - tiltingUI does not handle del key and its initial value is wrong.
        - tilting: all segments tilted by default (log angles)

TODO:
- remove custom flags when network is deleted.
- list scrollbars
- group DC components.


----------------------------
version 3:
    - export/import road xml.
    - patch AssetImporterAssetTemplate.RefreshCoroutine() to speed up prop model loading time
        micro-benchmark UIComponent.Find<T>(string) to see how much time they take up
    - m_clipSegmentEnds for segmentInfos. (this influences corners so its hard to do it per mesh)
    - option to unmerge bit-mask drop-downs
    - move DPT array elements up and down.
