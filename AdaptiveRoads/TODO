Tracks:
    - segment/node
        - cross import
        - render while drawing.
        - asym texture
    - embankment
        - lane corners
        - AR tool UI
        - prop embankment
    - track options:
        - vertical mesh offset
        - anti-flickering
        - ignore DC
        - scale to lane width.
        - implement exclude bend nodes.
        - overlay
        - hints

TODO:
    - bug fix: can't change custom flag name after loading AR road.
TODO:
- remove custom flags when network is deleted.
- list scrollbars
- group DC components.
- what if somebody changed the number of lanes in the asset and then AR NS data is deserialized with different lane count?


----------------------------
version 3:
    - export/import road xml.
    - patch AssetImporterAssetTemplate.RefreshCoroutine() to speed up prop model loading time
        micro-benchmark UIComponent.Find<T>(string) to see how much time they take up
    - m_clipSegmentEnds for segmentInfos. (this influences corners so its hard to do it per mesh)
    - option to unmerge bit-mask drop-downs
    - move DPT array elements up and down.
