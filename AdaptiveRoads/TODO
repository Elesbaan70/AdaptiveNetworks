- Patch DC nodes and bend nodes to use AR flags.

- bug: reset RoadEditorMainPanel after save (done untested)

- bug: fix lod is not loaded the first time.
    - calling rebuild lods in AssetImporterWizard and OnLoadPatch fixes the lod problem
      but I need a solution that also fixes the missing metadata.

- hint for vanilla flags/drop-downs (waiting for Hockenheim)

- learn usage of vanilla lane flags:
    - oneway left/right start/end

- buttons to set flags automatically:
    copy props to other lanes
    copy props to other elevations
    invert button.
    create LHT copy
    create backward copy
    auto create props:
        traffic lights
        man holes
        lane arrows
        yield/stop
        uturn props/sign
        parking/no paking
        pedestrian crossing sign
        no left/right turn
        speed limits KPH/MPH
        
        
    


version 2:
    mixed enum type bitmask
    custom flags
        data manager to manage them.
        UI to control them.
        all the network persistancy features.
    do not change name postfix. 0<->1
