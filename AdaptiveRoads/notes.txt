start/end flags:
    lane Start/End Flags :
        - it takes into consideration segment.invert, lane.direction, and LHT. ie segment.invert ^ lane.finalDirdection
        - taking lane.direction is usually not useful because medians are non-directional and pavements are bi-drectional.
        - my lane segment end start/end flags work in the exact same way (LHT only applicable to directional nodes)
    Segment YieldStart/YieldEnd flags:
        - means actual start and end node
        - currently my segment's node/segmentEnd flags also mean actual start/end node.
    Lane YieldStart/YieldEnd flags:
        - it takes into account invert flag
        - then forward lane removes YieldStart, and backward lane removes YieldEnd
            - this usualy is of no help because medians are non-directional and pavements are bi-drectional.
            - this also on a backward lane cars can go toward YieldStart


name binary:
    - AssetEditorRoadUtils.GetUniqueNetInfoName()
    - SaveAssetPanel.StripName():
      removes the last "." and everything before

    - conclusion:
        - name prefixes are stripped 
            when loading/saving
            for pillars/elevations/ground    
        - postfix is added to generate unique names
            for ground/elevations (not pillars)
            only when loading
            my patch changes the postfix to strippable prefix.
        - when saving:
            elevations and pillars keep their names
            ground will take the given asset name. TODO: change this
            TODO: rename all ground/elevations/pillars before saving.

- prop requirements:
    - no short/far turns (vanilla)
    - stop (vanilla)
    - give way (UK/ITA)
    - pedestrian crossing (ITA)
    - no u-turn (UK/Elly)
    - parking (UK)
    - no parking (vanilla)
